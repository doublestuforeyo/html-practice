                My hobbies include drawing, gaming, playing guitar, dancing, annoying my cat, and hanging out with my friends.

                I have been drawing since kindergarten! 
            <br>On my iPad, I would make animations
            <br>of stick figures doing cartwheels.
            <br>In elementary school, I was typically
            <br>drawing if not doing work. My passion
            <br>for art, however, began to drag  
            <br>as I became focused on other things.
            <br>Nevertheless, art still serves as a
            <br>creative outlet for me. I will be
            <br>forever grateful for this skill
            <br>and how far I've come!

                Technology has always fascinated me.
            <br>The circuits, metals, math, the whole
            <br>engineering aspect of it looked cool.
            <br>Now, I am captain of my robotics team
            <br>and make the most of every opportunity
            <br>thrown at me.
            <br>I first competed in the Tennessee state
            <br>championships for Robot Drone League. 
            <br>My team of three proudly left with 
            <br>second place! In the worldwide tournament,
            <br>We scored 5th place overall and had an
            <br>awesome time. With the momentum from my
            <br>first two matches, I'm definitely looking
            <br>forward to more exciting competitions!

                I had been playing guitar since 4th grade.
            <br>There's no complex origin story behind it,
            <br>I just thought guitar was cool. I started
            <br>at Stax Music Academy, which is meant for
            <br>people who want to take it seriously, but 
            <br>challenges are fun to me! From SMA, I met 
            <br>Graham Burks and he invited me to his
            <br>band: Above Jupiter. 
            <br>I play shows very frequently and love the
            <br>experience music has given me, as well as
            <br>the communities I've become a part of.

            <p id="cat-desc-1">This is Astrid. He is a grey tabby cat. He showed up at my doorstep one morning in winter of 2020. My mom and I were decordating the Chistmas tree. I opened the door for him, and after a few seconds of him looking curiously into my home, he stepped in and became our beloved cat. The Vet let us know he was born in July, so we celebrate his birthday on July 1st.</p>

            <p id="cat-desc-2"> He primarily enjoys wet food, whether it be tuna fish or chicken and gravy. Like all cats, he also enjoys to play with small, light objects. He occasionally sleeps at the foot of my bed. If I get lucky, he'll sleep right next to me. He's also not a fan of cameras, so it's hard to get nice, sophisticated pictures of him. No matter how much I have to clean his litter box or how many times he attacks me, I still love him infinitely.</p>
